# MVS-Nabhan-Sazzad

This repository contains a Multiview Stereo Pipeline. It is written in Python and utilizes open source libraries like OpenCV. The pipeline contains the ability to conduct image recognition with deep learning and is able to render 3d point cloud objects from a set of 2d images. The process is structured around a classical MVS apprach, identify points of interest, find corresponding points, filters the corresponding points, and reconstruct the object.
